The SmartContactManager is a web application that I developed using HTML, CSS (Tailwind),Thymleaf, JavaScript, Java, Spring Boot, and MySQL, where MySQL is used for database management. 
The primary goal of this Contact Management System is to manage various details such as reminders, mobile numbers, phone numbers, people, and addresses. This project is designed to be used from an administrative perspective, 
meaning only the administrator has access to the system. In management terminology, advanced contact management systems are often referred to as Individual Resource Management (IRM) tools—systems that help manage an individual’s
interactions with current and potential contacts while organizing, collaborating, and synchronizing health, lifestyle, and financial needs.

Technology used:

Java 8
Spring Boot/Eclipse
Spring Framework
JDBC
